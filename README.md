[![js-standard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](http://standardjs.com) [![semantic-release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

## Overview

This is a node.js back end server that pairs with [this React front end](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/p2wdb-image-upload). Together, they allow a user to upload images to the IPFS network via the [P2WDB](https://p2wdb.com) pinning cluster, and pay for a year of hosting with BCH. The cost of hosting an image (up to 1MB) is $0.01 USD for a year.

This repository is forked from [ipfs-service-provider](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/ipfs-service-provider).

## Requirements

- node **^14.18.2**
- npm **^8.3.0**
- Docker **^20.10.8**
- Docker Compose **^1.27.4**

## Installation

### Development Environment

**Note:** This software now uses an external go-ipfs IPFS node. The instructions below have not been updated to reflect this.

A development environment will allow you modify the code on-the-fly and contribute to the code base of this repository. [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) is recommended for running this code base as an IPFS Circuit Relay.

## Usage

- `npm start` Start server on live mode
- `npm run docs` Generate API documentation
- `npm test` Run mocha tests
- `docker-compose build` Build a 'production' Docker container
- `docker-compose up` Run the docker container
